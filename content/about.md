Hi there!
I'm a software engineer originally from Germany but currently living in Dublin
I have a passion for software engineering and enjoy building side projects using various technologies.
I also love participating in [Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com) when I find some time.
 
When I'm not coding, you can find me bouldering, hiking, or baking delicious sourdough bread.
